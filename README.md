# Other Key Features of the Syncfusion .NET MAUI Bar Chart

The other key features of Bar chart customization include chart features such as chart title, series customization, data labels customization, and axis labels customization.

## Chart Title: Setting the Stage

With the Syncfusion .NET MAUI Chart, adding a title is simple and intuitive. For our Bar Chart, we've chosen "For creating media" and "For getting information". The title of the chart provides quick information about the data being plotted in the chart.

## Customizing the Series Appearance

To customize the appearance of a series in the SfCartesianChart, you can adjust properties such as [Fill](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartSeries_Fill), [Stroke](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ColumnSeries_Stroke), and [Width](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ColumnSeries_Width). For instance, if you are using the BarSeries, you can apply different colors to each series.

## Data labels customization

Customize the data labels to better suit your needs. To customization data labels, you can use properties such as [LabelStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartDataLabelSettings.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartDataLabelSettings_LabelStyle), [LabelPlacement](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartDataLabelSettings.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartDataLabelSettings_LabelPlacement), [UseSeriesPalette](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartDataLabelSettings.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartDataLabelSettings_UseSeriesPalette).

## Axis labels customization

To customize the x and y axes, you can use properties such as [LabelStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartAxis_LabelStyle), [AxisLineStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartAxis_AxisLineStyle), and [MajorTickStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartAxis_MajorTickStyle).
